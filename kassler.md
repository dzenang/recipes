## Notes/Hints

- A thick piece of boneless cooked ham could be used as an alternative, although it won't have the exact same flavor. Experiment with different brands to find the one that suits your taste.
- For a similar flavor, consider using a thick piece of Canadian peameal bacon. While not identical, it serves as a substitute.
- Explore European delis to find Kasseler; it might be labeled as smoked pork chops or cured and smoked chops. I've had success finding Kasseler in Polish, Dutch, and, of course, German delis. Be open to trying anything labeled as smoked pork chops or cured and smoked chops—you might be pleasantly surprised.
